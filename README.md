# Weekly Programming Challenge

## 001: Add up multiples

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.
Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1001.

## 002: Run-length encoding of a list

Implement the so-called run-length encoding data compression method. Consecutive duplicates of elements are encoded as lists (N E) where N is the number of duplicates of the element E.

```javascript
encode([a, a, a, b, b, c, a, a]) == [[3, a], [2, b], [1, c], [2, a]]
```

## 003: Coin sums

In England the currency is made up of pound, £, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation: `1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, £1 (100p), £2 (200p)`. It is possible to make £2 in the following way: `1×£1 + 1×50p + 2×20p + 1×5p + 1×2p + 3×1p`. How many different ways can £2 be made using any number of coins?
