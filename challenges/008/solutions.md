# 008: Dijkstras' algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is an algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph, which may represent, for example, road networks. The task is to find the shortest path between Frankfurt and Munich by using [this map](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/ad/MapGermanyGraph.svg).

| A | B | Distance |
| --------- | ------ | --- |
| Augsburg | Karlsruhe | 250 |
| Augsburg | Munich | 84 |
| Erfurt | Wuerzburg | 186 |
| Frankfurt | Kassel | 173 |
| Frankfurt | Mannheim | 85 |
| Frankfurt | Wuerzburg | 217 |
| Karlsruhe | Mannheim | 80 |
| Kassel | Munich | 502 |
| Munich | Nuremberg | 167 |
| Nuremberg | Stuttgart | 183 |
| Nuremberg | Wuerzburg | 103 |
