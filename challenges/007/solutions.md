# 007: Regex for dates

Match dates in YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM(:SS) format with a regex. YYYY should be a year between 1000 and 2012, and everything else should be a valid month, date, hour, minute and second. The seconds should be optional. Don't worry about leap years, and assume that all months have 30 days.
